Hello! I'm Azlan Khan, an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for web development and technology. My journey in the tech world began after completing my Matriculation exams when I took my first step into the world of Website Development and Freelancing classes at Brains College. While this was an exciting experience, I lacked the expertise at that time to execute practical projects effectively.

I continued my educational path at Punjab Groups of Colleges, where I am currently pursuing my Intermediate (ICS) and am in Part 2. During this time, I re-ignited my passion for coding by practicing HTML and CSS, focusing on creating responsive projects. This hands-on practice helped me enhance my web development skills.

Currently, I am also enrolled in Robotics & AI Engineering at PIAIC, expanding my knowledge in cutting-edge technologies. My core skills include:

HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
C Language
Python
I am deeply passionate about becoming a Full Stack Developer and I am committed to putting in my best effort to achieve this goal. I also hold a verified Microsoft Badge, which reflects my dedication to continuous learning. You can view my badge here: [Microsoft Badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/ca0df133-6ea0-4903-88a4-310c1e8279f5/public_url)
